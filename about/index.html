             <h1 class="team-title">About the Founder: <br>Keri Barnett</h1>
               <p class="team-description">Keri is a Front-End Web Developer and experienced marketing professional. With Product, Project, and Pricing Management under her belt, she achieved exceptional results in the corporate arena.
<br><br>
At just 20 years old, Keri was promoted to an associate manager role after only 8 months at the company. It was during that time that she learned every position, subbing for anyone who was out of the office. By age 22, she was manager to 9 direct reports and about 30 indirect reports, specializing in SAP problem resolution, email communication, and new systems training. She was even sent to other locations to lead a smooth implementation of new SAP modules.
<br><br>
Soon after graduating college, Keri worked in Product Management for one of the most successful lighting companies in the world. She completed intricate and time sensitive projects that required a strict compliance with Federal regulations.  With a clear understanding of consumer-focused marketing, she worked with suppliers to launch products that would garner the most sales while providing packaging input to make it more appealing on shelf.
<br><br>
Keri moved on to Pricing Management where she managed the pricing for all Consumer accounts in the country—including the company’s largest one.  It was within that role that she successfully managed a User Interface project, dismantling a system that took 6 years to build and building another one in 3 months.  The project required Keri to create User Stories, break down SAP mapping, create process maps, manually create training material for all users, and hold training sessions for over 200 users.  In leading this project, she saved the company $700,000 for the remainder of the year, and $1.6 million annually. The project was nominated for an Excellence Award.
<br><br>
Fast forward to now, where Keri is a Front-End Web Developer.  She took courses in tech to increase her overall marketability, not knowing that she would love coding and creating websites.  With a desire to infuse her marketing experience with her tech skills, Keri founded Barnett Marketing Solutions to help local companies, start-ups, and entrepreneurs achieve their dreams without worrying about the marketing aspects.  Her goal is to see growth in every project and establish long-term professional relationships.
<br><br>
She lives in New Jersey with her husband and son. In her free time she loves to workout (she used to be a personal trainer), sing, and spend time with her friends and family.

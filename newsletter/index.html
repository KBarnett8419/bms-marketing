    </div>

<div class="section">
  <div class="tip-1-img" id="tip-1-img"></div>
    <div class="tip-1">
      <h2>1.	An email sign-up area (or pop-up)</h2>
        <p>I think this one gets overlooked a lot because one might feel that his or her business isn’t “that kind of business.” Some think email lists are only for corporations or businesses that provide office-related services.  But that couldn’t be further from the truth.  Email lists exist not to annoy existing and potential customers, but to remind them of your business and what you have to offer.<br><br>
As an example, let’s just say you are a makeup artist whose business runs on serving a mix of regular and new clients. You pride yourself on maintaining your clients by being professional, reliable and giving a great makeup application. And that’s great, but they can forget about you until the next time they need you…which could be a while.  It might sound understandable from a practical sense, but you ARE running a business.  As a professional, you need to inform your existing and potential customers that they need you more than occasionally.  Through your weekly / bi-weekly /monthly newsletters, you can talk about the latest makeup trends or high-in-demand products that you have on hand. OR you could base your content around certain holiday seasons and generate lead time for people to book with you.<br><br>
BONUS Tip: In addition to the sign-up area, website visitors should be given an incentive to sign-up. If we use the same example of being a makeup artist, the incentive could be a FREE lash or contour & highlight application.  Let’s face it, people like free things.  I’d like to think that if you’re reading this, you were persuaded because you wanted these free tips!

      <h2>2.	Examples of your <span>BEST</span> work</h2>
        <p>I see this all the time-- a person has great reviews by word-of-mouth, but when you go to his website, the pictures look like they haven’t been updated since 1992!  That certainly doesn’t mean that the person can’t do the work, but as a visitor of the site I wouldn’t be able to tell based on what I’m seeing.<br><br>
There could be a few reasons for the lack of recent pictures:
            <ol>
              <li>The business owner just doesn’t take many pictures of his work.</li>
              <li>He doesn't have the budget to update the website.</li>
              <li>He mainly relies on word-of-mouth marketing, so his focus is not on maintaining the website (even though that’s the MAIN form of research and communication today)!</li>
          </ol>
Truth is, there are developers out there who will update your pictures for a very affordable price, especially if they built the site in a way that makes it easy to swap the pictures out.  If you need your website to be updated with your best photos, <a href="http://barnettmarketing.org/contact" target="_blank">we can help.</a>  Let your work do the selling for you!

      <h2>3.	A <span>CLEAR</span> method of contacting you</h2>
        <p>Here's another situation: The website is absolutely beautiful with information about the product and even the history behind it. But when it was time for me to ask a question to the seller, I could not find the “Contact” page anywhere.  After clicking through several pages, I finally found the link <i>super small </i> at the very bottom of the page.<br><br>
Did the seller even WANT to be contacted?  What if I had a family reunion and needed a bulk order which would have resulted in significant revenue for her?  Honestly, if I have to try THAT hard to give someone my money, I would rather take my business elsewhere.  You DON’T want to make the same mistake. Always make it easy for visitors to contact you.  If you are worried about spam emails, <a href="http://barnettmarketing.org/contact" target="_blank">you can always have a contact form with a captcha</a> to make sure you are hearing from actual human beings.

        <p>If you read this and thought, “Check, check, check. I do ALLLL this already,” kudos to you!  If you are missing even ONE item out of the three, <a href="http://barnettmarketing.org/contact" target="_blank">you need to take action now.</a>  Don’t miss out on amazing opportunities because your website isn’t where it should be.  Let’s get on track!
